					<p>I am a <b>critical HCI education researcher</b>. I pursue ethical, equitable, and liberatory technology futures by envisioning novel pedagogies for critical design education and exploring ways to broaden participation within post-secondary CS learning contexts. My interdisciplinary work draws upon ideas from human-computer interaction (HCI), computing education research, design theory & methods, accessibility, information science, and software engineering. I often partner with communities of HCI and computing educators, working to identify pedagogical challenges and evaluate potential solutions. I employ qualitative and design research methods to deeply explore these contexts and the experiences of the people within them.</p>

                    <p>In Fall 2024, I started as an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the <a href="https://ritchieschool.du.edu/academics-education/departments/computer-science" target="_blank">Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.du.edu/" target="_blank">University of Denver</a>.

Ko</a> at the University of Washington Information School for my doctoral studies and <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/">Margaret M. Burnett</a> at Oregon State University CS for my undergraduate research.</p>

                    <h3>Lab</h3>                
                    <p>I lead the TEACCUP lab at the University of Denver. We conduct research around <u>T</u>eaching <u>E</u>thical <u>A</u>wareness, <u>C</u>ritical <u>C</u>omputing, and <u>U</u>nderstanding <u>P</u>eople in computing education contexts. (Lab website coming soon)</p>
                    
                    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Critical Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) & Design Pedagogy</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How might we enable computing students to think more critically about the technologies they create and the real-world impacts of their design decisions?</li> 
                        <li>What kinds of pedagogical interventions might help students recognize and mitigate technological design biases? </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This branch of my research develops and evaluates theoretically-grounded pedagogical methods and tools for teaching accessiblity concepts, inclusive design, and critical & ethical thinking in computing education contexts. This work can also include developing tools to support critical and ethical CS education.</p>

                    <h4>CS Educator Knowledge Development</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What do computing educators need to know to effectively teach critical & ethical computing topics?</li> 
                        <li>What resources and supports might CS educators need to develop these competencies?</li>
                        <li>How can educator communities (such as communities of practice) support each other in developing and sustaining knowledge?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This branch of my research explores the pedagogical content knowledge that educators develop as they become experts in teaching critical computing topics, with a specific focus on accessibility and inclusive design knowledge. This work includes the development of workshops and community-based interventions to share and evaluate teacher knowledge.</p>

                    <h4>Theoretical Foundations for Computing Design Education</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do design and computing education intersect?</li> 
                        <li>How is the work of computing design similar to (different than) other applied design fields?</li>
                        <li>What "lenses" might we leverage to better understand how biases and values become embedded in designed artifacts?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This branch of my research develops new theoretical models for understanding the intersection of design and computing within educational contexts. This work tends to draw on interdisciplinary expertise (e.g. critical theory, information science, translation studies), enabling unique perspectives for making sense of how computing students learn to design technology.</p>

                    <h4>Queering Computing Education & Technology Design</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do students and educators with non-normative identities interact with computing education?</li> 
                        <li>How might normative ideas be (explicitly or implicitly) encoded through the design of technology?</li> 
                        <li>How might we challenge & subvert technology design norms to create more accessible, inclusive, and equitable technologies?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This branch of my research explores how people differentially experience and navigate both the norms of computing education (which is known to privilege some identities over others) and technological design norms (which tend to assume normative capabilities, contexts, and identities of users). Understanding these experiences can help us identify and challenge implicit assumptions in technological contexts, supporting efforts to broaden participation in computing, create more inclusive technologies, and address issues of algorithmic bias and fairness.</p>

                    <p>I have edited or authored chapters in a few online textbooks. Unlike print books, these are free, digital, searchable, interactive, and web-accessible resources.

                    <p>University of Denver COMP 3/4100 | Teaching Winter 2025, planned Winter 2026 </p>
                    <p>    
                        This course covers the foundations of human-computer interaction for undergraduate and graduate students, such as basic HCI theories and principles, protoyping, empirical user research, and critical and ethical perspectives on HCI. Students apply their learning by incrementally building a prototype demonstrating HCI principles then, in groups, further developing and evaluating prototypes through user studies. Through discussions and presentations, students develop their communication skills. Fulfills the Ethics requirement within the undergraduate CS program. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Intro to Computer Science I</h3>
                    <p>University of Denver COMP 1201 | Next planned offering Fall 2025 </p>
                    <p> 
                        This introductory (CS0) course introduces undergraduate students to the discipline of computer science beyond programming, discussing topics like algorithmic thinking, career readiness, and ethical perspectives on technology development. Students engage in interactive activities and group discussions to build CS foundations and identities. First in a three-course series. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>User-Centered Design Methods</h3>

                    <p> 
                        This undergraduate class teaches students design thinking skills in the domain of information and computing. It leverages multiple forms of active learning, involves a significant amount of studio-based learning, and helps students develop creative confidence.

                        This undergraduate software engineering class teaches foundations of team-based software development, leveraging the latest research on coordination, cooperation, and human cognition in software development. Students leave ready to become meaningful contributors to teams big and small, but also to understand the processes that teams use and how they can improve them.

                            EduCHI's annual symposium brings together an international community of scholars and practitioners to discuss and shape the future of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education. Though small and growing, EduCHI is the leading venue focusing specifically on HCI education. I am on the symposium steering committee and have been a part of this community since 2018, acting in several roles like technical program chair (2023, 2025) and co-organizer of the inagural HCI pedagogy workshop for graduate students and early-career faculty.
